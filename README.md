# Numerical Algorithms
#### The MATLAB functions contained in these folders are **numerical approximation algorithms** made by me in my Mechanical Engineering Problem Solving Class *(MECH 105)*.
This branch contains the three algorithms: *Simpson's 1/3 Rule*, *LU Factorization*, and *The Falseposition Method*, which can be found in the three folders **Numerical Integration**, **System of Equations**, and **Root-Finding Methods** respectively.
