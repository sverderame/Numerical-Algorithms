# Numerical Algorithms
#### The MATLAB functions contained in these folders are **numerical approximation algorithms** made by me in my Mechanical Engineering Problem Solving Class *(MECH 105)*.
This branch contains the three algorithms: *Simpson.m*, *falseposition.m*, and *luFactor.m*, which can be found in the three folders **Simpson Rule**, **Falseposition Method**, and **LU Decomposition** respectively.
