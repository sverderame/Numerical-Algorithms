# Numerical Algorithms
The MATLAB functions contained in these folders are **numerical approximation algorithms** made by me in my Mechanical Engineering Problem Solving Class *(MECH 105)*.
This branch contains the three algorithms: *Simpson's Composite Rule*, *LU Factorization*, and *The Falseposition Method*, which can be found in the three folders *
