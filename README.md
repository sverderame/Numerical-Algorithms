# Numerical Algorithms
#### The MATLAB functions contained in these folders are **numerical approximation algorithms** made by me in my Mechanical Engineering Problem Solving Class *(MECH 105)*.
This branch contains the three algorithms: *Simpson's 1/3 Rule*, *The Falseposition Method*, and *LU Factorization*, which can be found in the three folders **Numerical Integration**, **Root-Finding Methods**, and **System of Equations** respectively.
