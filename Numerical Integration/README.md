# Simpson.m
## Simpson's rule is a method for numerical integration, the numerical approximation of definite integrals. 
This particular algorithm integrates experimental data using Simpson's 1/3 Rule. The algorithm numerically evaluates the integral of the vector of function values 'y' with respect to 'x'. If there are an odd number of intervals in the data, this algorithm will use the trapezoidal rule for the last interval, and then add up both summations at the end to get an overall approximation of the data given.
